Χαίρετε!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I was born in Cyprus, grew up outside D.C., and now find myself studying Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I've spent the past few years at Pitt going wherever my interests may take me. As a result of this, I've had the pleasure of being a part of the [ADMT](https://db.cs.pitt.edu/group/), [Kovashka](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/), and [LIFE](http://www.lifelab.pitt.edu/) labs, all of which were great experiences and research vastly different areas.

I love Research and Computer Science, but at the end of the day, I just want to work on some engaging problems and hopefully improve some.
